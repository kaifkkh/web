                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
                    It is used to design web pages using a markup
                    language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext
                    and Markup language. Hypertext defines the
                    link between the web pages. A markup language
                    is used to define the text document within tag
                    which defines the structure of web pages.
                    HTML is a markup language that is used by the
                    browser to manipulate text, images, and other
                    content to display it in the required format.

                    Graphic designing
                </h1>
                <p>Graphic design is the practice of creating visual content to communicate messages and convey ideas. It involves combining elements such as typography, colors, images, and illustrations to produce visually appealing and impactful designs. Graphic designers utilize software tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to create a wide range of materials, including logos, branding materials, advertisements, brochures, and website graphics. They consider factors like layout, composition, hierarchy, and visual storytelling to create designs that effectively communicate the desired message and resonate with the target audience. Graphic designers often collaborate with clients, marketers, and other stakeholders to understand project requirements and deliver compelling visual solutions. Continuous creativity, a strong sense of aesthetics, and an understanding of design principles are key to success in graphic design.</p>

                Freelancing refers to working as an independent professional, typically on a project basis, without being employed by a specific company or organization. Freelancers offer their services to clients on a contract or freelance basis, allowing them to have more flexibility and control over their work. In the context of web development or graphic design, freelancers can provide their expertise to clients in creating websites, designing graphics, or other related services. Freelancers often have the freedom to choose their clients, set their own rates, and manage their own schedules. They may find clients through networking, online platforms, or referrals. However, freelancing also requires self-discipline, effective time management, and the ability to market oneself to attract clients and maintain a steady stream of work</p>
