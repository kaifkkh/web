        <h2>Freelancer</h2>
        <p>Freelancing refers to working as an independent professional, typically on a project basis, without being employed by a specific company or organization. Freelancers offer their services to clients on a contract or freelance basis, allowing them to have more flexibility and control over their work. In the context of web development or graphic design, freelancers can provide their expertise to clients in creating websites, designing graphics, or other related services. Freelancers often have the freedom to choose their clients, set their own rates, and manage their own schedules. They may find clients through networking, online platforms, or referrals. However, freelancing also requires self-discipline, effective time management, and the ability to market oneself to attract clients and maintain a steady stream of work</p>
